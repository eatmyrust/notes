# Slack templates for Alertmanager
Alertmanager can be configured to send custom text utilizing variables with information about the alert that was received
```yaml
global:
  slack_api_url: '<slack_webhook_url>'

route:
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'
  group_by: [alertname, datacenter, app]

receivers:
- name: 'slack-notifications'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
    text: 'https://internal.myorg.net/wiki/alerts/{{ .GroupLabels.app }}/{{ .GroupLabels.alertname }}'
```
Prometheus alert rules can be configured to send variables with useful information about the alert to alertmanager
###### Prometheus Rule
```yaml
groups:
- name: Instances
  rules:
  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: page
    # Prometheus templates apply here in the annotation and label fields of the alert.
    annotations:
      description: '{{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }} has been down for more than 5 minutes.'
      summary: 'Instance {{ $labels.instance }} down'
```
These variables can then be used in the Alertmanager config
###### Receiver
```yaml
- name: 'team-x'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
    # Alertmanager templates apply here.
    text: "<!channel> \nsummary: {{ .CommonAnnotations.summary }}\ndescription: {{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}"
```
