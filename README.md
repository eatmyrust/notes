# Notes

This repository is used as remote storage for notes taken with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes taking tool. Each folder corresponds to a vault within Obsidian, and a local instance can be easily established by cloning this repository and configuring Obsidian to register the folders as vaults.
